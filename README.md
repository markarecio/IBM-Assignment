# Arithmetic Expressions in Python

In this section, we will explore examples of basic arithmetic expressions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# Function to multiply and add two integers
def multiply_and_add(a, b):
    multiplication = a * b
    addition = a + b
    return multiplication, addition

# Example usage
num1 = 8
num2 = 5
product, sum_result = multiply_and_add(num1, num2)

print(f"Multiplication of {num1} and {num2}: {product}")
print(f"Addition of {num1} and {num2}: {sum_result}")

# Function to convert minutes to hours
def minutes_to_hours(minutes):
    hours = minutes / 60
    return hours

# Example usage
minutes = 120
converted_hours = minutes_to_hours(minutes)

print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {converted_hours} hours.")
